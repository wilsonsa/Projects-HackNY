To run the game, run the file "runThisOne.py"

Firstly, you should know this project is still a work in progress. There
are still bugs in this program that become quite obvious once you start
playing the game. However, this is a bare-bones version in the sense that, 
if played like it's supposed to (ie grabbing when you're supposed to, and
adding on to the larger puzzle), it should work to completion (ie the 
program does check the validity of the word, allows you to drag tiles onto
the board, etc).

What my project is:
	My project is an electronic copy of the board game Scrabble. This
game is intended to be played by two players. The application containes a
large board on the left side of the screen. On the right side of the screen 
containes the scoreboard, the tile pieces, and a slew of other buttons 
including one that draws a new tile, one that allows you to scramble up 
the pieces on your rack, and one that allows you to submit pieces once you 
are done placing pieces on the board.  
	The pieces on your rack can simply be dragged and dropped to your
desired place on the board. The normal rules of scrabble apply: try to build
on to the existing crossword. Try to maximize your score by strategically
creating words and using the point bonuses on the board. 
	One important Nuance: There contains a Grab Bag button. Every time
prior to pressing submit, you must fill your rack with 7 letters. Putting
in a automatic draw function would have been a simple implementation, but 
this button gives the game a better real-life feel of drawing tiles as 
opposed to having them drawn for you each time. 

How to install and run project:
 	It is best to have IDLE installed. Unzip the file TermProjectCore. 
Right click on the file "runThisOne" and click on "Edit with IDLE." Press
"F5" on your keyboard to run the file and the application should run from
there.
