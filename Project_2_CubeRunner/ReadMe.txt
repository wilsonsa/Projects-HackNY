Running this for the first time should work. However, after 
you run the file, two .txt files should appear on your 
desktop called "highScore" and "test". In order to run the
program again, simply delete these files and run sphereRunner.
This was part of an experiment I was doing-- it is still
a work in progress. 

Also, sometimes, the program does not end after crashing into
a red sphere. However, this can be resolved hitting "r" for
restart. Aside from this, most everything else should be, 
more or less, intuitive.
